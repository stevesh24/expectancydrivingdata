# expectancydrivingdata

This data set gives the raw data to create expectancy heat maps of driving targets in driving images.  In an online study, 172 observers viewed 150 greyscale images of driving scenes taken in 2012 in Birmingham, UK.  For each image, the observers were given a driving target (e.g., pedestrian, sign, car) specific to that image and were asked to select (by mouse click) one location where they would expect that target to appear.  

There are 3 zipped files (“driving images 1.zip”, “driving images 2.zip”, “driving images 3.zip”).  Each zipped file has 50 jpg images, named “img” + image_id (from 1 to 150) + “_“ + alternative id.   

The file ”questions.pdf” contains the question for each image, in order, giving the observer the driving target to place in the scene.

The file “heat map data.txt” contains the responses of the 172 online observers.  Each row has the following format, separated by spaces: <br>
observer_id image_id x y

The data have been presented at Vision Sciences Society, May 2015, St. Petes Beach, FL: <br>
